A Password Safe Client for iOS that can be found on the Apple App Store here:

This project will build in XCode as is. You will need Google Drive and Dropbox developer accounts (with keys/secrets) to use the cloud based features.

# Caveat
This is my first iOS/Objective C project and as such I'm sure contains many many imperfections, and is showing classic signs of slow and organic development. I hope it is still of some modest value.
